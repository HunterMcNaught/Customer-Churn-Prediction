# Customer Churn Prediction
This project analyzes customer churn using a decision tree model to identify factors influencing customer attrition. 
The dataset includes customer contract details, payment methods, and usage patterns to predict whether a customer will leave (Churn: Yes/No). 
The goal is to provide insights for proactive retention strategies and improve customer loyalty.

**Technologies Used**
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)
Google Colab for data preprocessing and model training
Decision Tree Classifier for churn prediction
**Key Findings**
Contract type is the strongest predictor of churn, with month-to-month contracts showing the highest risk
Customers with lower tenure and higher monthly charges are more likely to churn
The decision tree model achieved 65 percent accuracy, with high recall (88 percent) for churners, making it useful for identifying at-risk customers
